A Brief History of Armenia
Armenia is one of the oldest countries in the world, with a rich and complex history that spans thousands of years. The region was home to ancient civilizations as early as 3000 BC. Around 600 BC, the Kingdom of Urartu, which had ruled the area, was succeeded by the Kingdom of Armenia.
In 301 AD, Armenia became the first country in the world to adopt Christianity as a state religion, under King Tiridates III and the guidance of Saint Gregory the Illuminator. This marked a key moment in Armenian identity and culture.
Over the centuries, Armenia was invaded and ruled by various empires, including the Roman, Byzantine, Persian, Arab, Seljuk, Mongol, Ottoman, and Russian empires. Despite these challenges, Armenians preserved their language, church, and traditions.
In 1915, during World War I, the Armenian Genocide occurred under the Ottoman Empire, where an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were systematically killed.
After a brief period of independence from 1918 to 1920, Armenia became part of the Soviet Union. It regained independence in 1991, following the collapse of the USSR.
Since independence, Armenia has faced both progress and difficulties, including the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite these challenges, Armenia remains a proud nation with a vibrant culture, strong diaspora, and deep historical roots.
